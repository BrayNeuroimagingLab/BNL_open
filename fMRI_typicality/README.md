This is the GitHub repository for the code from Tansey et al. "Functional MRI responses to naturalistic stimuli are increasingly typical across early childhood".

There are 3 files for code:
1) study_funcs.py -> the functions written for the purposes for the analysis that are called by the other 2 scripts
2) TemporalROIAnalyses -> this is the code for the shred group average signal regression analysis. The results of this analysis can be found in the "Group average signal regression analysis" section of the Results, and in Figure 4.
3) SpatialROIAnalyses -> this is the code for both the diffuse to localized analysis and the Dice coefficient analysis. You can find these results in their respective sections of the Result and in Figure 5 of the manuscript.
